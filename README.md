# CrohnsPred: Deep Neural Network For Crohn Disease Prediction
This repository holds the CrohnsPred model for Genetic Risk prediction of Crohn's Disease.

## Model

The model architecture, training and testing is available at __CrohnsPred.ipynb__.

To run the train and test pipelines from scratch, simply acces the up stated _.ipynb_ file and run the cells in order.

To use the Web Dashboard created to visualize the model predictions on real data, visit the __belfioreasia/WebApp__ repository.

## Data
All genetic data preprocessing is described in the data_preprocessing.ipynb file. 

All mutations data from the PGS Catalog is described in the mutations_preprocessing.ipynb file.

The formatting process for the 100k dataset is described in the one_million_dataset_formatting.ipynb file.

## Dependencies
All necessary imports, libraries and modules are specified at the top of each .ipynb file.
